        <h3>About HelpYourselfSolar</h3>
        <p>There are a lot of different kinds of solar companies.  It may not be readily apparent why our business model works to provide you with the best value in solar.  The key is that we are not focused solely on the customer.  We look at every person invovlved in the project and make an effort to make sure that the project works for them.  As far as the installation goes, the most important people will be the installers.  The best way to make it clear how we are able to get really good and really experienced installation contractors is to see our pitch to installers.</p>

          <p className="Highlight">We understand solar contractors.  We grew out of solar contracting.  We are looking for independent contractors who are experienced experts in solar installation.  We know that the big companies appear experienced, but send out crews with much higher turnover than small businesses.  We know that there are cut rate subcontractors hoping to make a profit out of unprofitable business through volume.  We know that your best business has always been retail sales, but we also know that it could be better.</p>
          <p className="Highlight">The most profitable part of your business is the installation.  You are making money when you're on the roof, not when you're measuring properties, doing quotes, educating clients, doing plans, going to the city, or doing inspections.  If you've worked for a big company as a subcontractor you know that you could be making more money if someone took care of all of that and left you to just install solar systems.</p> 
          <p className="Highlight">But what do the big companies do?  Either they continually cut your rates or they put you in bidding wars against a bunch of other installation companies. We don't just call the contractors we work with "partners" while we treat them like that. In addition to providing a service to the homeowners, we look at ourselves and providing a service for you.  We are your outside sales, inside sales, admin, designer, runner, and we do the inspections too.  We don't require you to wear our gear or take time out to attend our meetings. We respect you and we show it.</p>

      <p>That's our pitch to installers, but for the most part we aren't forming relationships with them through mass marketing. We have been in the solar industry for more than a decade and have made many connections.  Our installers are people we have sought out to work with.  They are companies that were already successful, usually both installing for other companies and on their own sales.</p>
